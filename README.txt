Seung Jun Lee – Notes & Archive

This site is a personal archive designed and customized by Seung Jun Lee.
It focuses on recording everyday moments, photographs, and technical notes,
structured around a clean, grid-based layout for clarity and long-term use.

The design has been heavily customized to reflect a minimal, archive-oriented
aesthetic, with emphasis on readability, responsive behavior, and simplicity
across desktop and mobile environments.

This project is intended for personal documentation and creative archiving.
